## Eligibility

To serve on any governing body, council, or committee of the Open Mainframe Project, an individual must:

- Be willing and able to fulfill the applicable responsibilities, and
- Comply with all applicable policies of the Linux Foundation and the Open Mainframe Project, including [Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/antitrust-policy) and [Open Mainframe Project Code of Conduct](https://tac.openmainframeproject.org/code_of_conduct.html).

Failure to meet these requirements may result in removal, suspension, or ineligibility to participate.

## Nominations

Nominations are done via email. Members of the electorate group may nominate someone else in the electorate group or self-nominate. All nominations must include the nomineeâ€™s name, company affiliation, and a short background on the nominee and why they wish to serve in the role. All nominations are confirmed before the election.

## Elections

If there are the same number or fewer nominees for the given role as there are persons to be elected, those nominees are automatically elected. The electorate will be informed of this via email.

An election will be held if there are more nominees for the given role than the number of persons elected. The Open Mainframe Project uses [LFX PCC Voting](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/project-control-center/v2-latest-version/collaborations/voting) for the election process. Electorates will be sent an email with the complete list of nominees to review and a separate email from LFX PCC Voting with a unique link to submit their ballot. Voting will be done using the checkbox method; electors will checkbox the individual(s) they wish to elect.

Election results will be announced to the electorate and the relevant committee the day after the election closes.

If you have questions about the election process, please contact the [Open Mainframe Project staff](https://members.openmainframeproject.org).
